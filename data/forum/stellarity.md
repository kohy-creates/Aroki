:x: **Stellarity (Datapack) is no longer supported. No support from its creators will be provided.**

The project was *discontinued* on <t:1751060760:f> (<t:1751060760:R>), reaching the *end of support* on <t:1768594980:f> (<t:1768594980:R>). It won't receive any more content updates nor be ported to newer Minecraft versions. 
You may still ask your question in <#1431387845834051765> for the community to answer.

In the meantime, feel free to check out [**Stellarity ~ Enlightened**](<https://github.com/koharas-Basement/Stellarity-Fabric/>), which is *a WIP re-up of Stellarity* - this time as a proper mod.
